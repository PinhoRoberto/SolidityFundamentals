# Solidity Fundamentals 🔗

Welcome to Solidity ! This repository contains my progress through blockchain development fundamentals.

## 📚 What's Inside

- **Basic Contracts**: Simple smart contracts covering core concepts
- **Learning Exercises**: Hands-on practice with Solidity syntax and patterns
- **Progressive Projects**: Building complexity as I advance

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Remix IDE (for testing and deployment)
- OpenZeppelin (for secure contract patterns)

## 📈 Learning Path

1. **Variables & Data Types** - Understanding state variables, mappings, arrays
2. **Functions & Modifiers** - Public/private functions, view/pure, custom modifiers
3. **Events & Inheritance** - Contract communication and code reuse
4. **Security Patterns** - Following best practices and avoiding common pitfalls
